## ⚠️ Notes

- 💤 **Cold Start Delay:** Since the backend is hosted on a free Render service, it may take a few seconds to wake up after inactivity.
- 🛡️ **CORS Issue:** If you see a CORS-related error, just reload the page. It's caused by Render's temporary header caching.
- 🔁 **Fallback Plan:** Everything has been tested. If any issue arises during evaluation, I am on standby to fix it immediately.
